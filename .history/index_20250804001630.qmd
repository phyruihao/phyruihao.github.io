Ruio Liao is an AI researcher and doctoral candidate whose work lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning, physics-informed modeling, and embodied intelligence. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in reinforcement learning in a top research group in China and is concurrently involved in applied algorithmic work through an internship with Terminus Group. His research spans symbolic PDE optimization, diffusion-based policy learning, meta-reinforcement learning with principled exploration, and vision-language-action integration for embodied agents, with a strong emphasis on robustness, generalization, and real-world scientific decision-making.

He has developed workflows that tightly couple large language models with symbolic and physics-inspired modules—such as equation solvers, topological property predictors, and structured prompt optimization pipelines—to enable interpretable and sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks. His interests also include the design of vertical domain-specialized language models (e.g., for scientific domains like topological materials) and the integration of diffusion policies into online and off-policy reinforcement learning frameworks.

Ruio’s interdisciplinary academic trajectory spans mechanical engineering (B.S.), physics (M.S.), and AI, reflecting a blend of theoretical rigor and practical system-building. He has contributed to research on emergent behaviors in meta-RL, information-gain-based exploration, and diffusion policy reversibility, and he frequently engages in refining the interface between language models and structured scientific reasoning. 

He is additionally active in crafting evaluation methodologies for domain adaptation and fine-tuning of LLMs, including the construction of specialized benchmarks and insight-driven prompt optimization strategies that balance expressiveness with alignment to expert intent.
