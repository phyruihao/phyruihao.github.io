Ruio Liao is an AI researcher and doctoral candidate whose work lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning, physics-informed modeling, and embodied intelligence. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in reinforcement learning in a top research group in China and is concurrently involved in applied algorithmic work through an internship with Terminus Group. His research spans symbolic PDE optimization, diffusion-based policy learning, meta-reinforcement learning with principled exploration, and vision-language-action integration for embodied agents, with a strong emphasis on robustness, generalization, and real-world scientific decision-making.
